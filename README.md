# AI Code Generation and Model Deployment

This project demonstrates how AI tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT can assist in backend code generation, and how to deploy a simple machine learning model using Flask.
Task Breakdown
ðŸ”¹ Part 1: AI for Code Generation (GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT)
Task:
Use GitHub Copilot (or ChatGPT) to generate a simple CRUD app backend in Node.js or Python (Flask).
Document:
The prompt/code comment you gave
The code Copilot/AI generated
Any changes you had to make manually
Reflect in 3â€“4 lines:
How did AI help?
Where did you need to intervene?
Part 2: Deploying a Simple AI Model
Task:
Use a basic ML model (e.g., a Decision Tree classifier on Iris dataset using scikit-learn)
Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI:
Create a small API endpoint (/predict) that receives input and returns prediction
Document:
Model training code
Flask/FastAPI code for deployment
Sample input/output
